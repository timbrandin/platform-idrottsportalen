# Systools puppet module

Systools is a puppet module that contains some essential tools
that we want to have on all servers:

* HTOP - handy improvement of top
* Emacs - The best operating system in the world.
* Curl - Download stuff
* Aptitude - Because, come on...

Systools also executes apt-get update, which is nice.
